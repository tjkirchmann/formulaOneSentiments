7nd6t7,ItsAesthus,1514780308.0,1516119730.0,False,True,False,t3_7nd6t7,29,False,100,"Why do I refer to 2008 as the end of an era? Well, since that year, three teams have, between them, won the last nine titles, and unless Ferrari sort out their reliability issues next year, they look set to make it ten next year. It's even worse elsewhere; only two engine makes, as well as only two factories, have won either the constructors' or drivers' championships. Button, Vettel, Hamilton, and Rosberg are the only champions; Germany and Britain the only champion countries.

I say all this because, in a way, 2008 heralded the end of the Formula 1 that most of us (Red Bull and Mercedes fans, to some extent, notwithstanding) truly *love:* about two dozen of the world's best competing for the ultimate crown. Not one or two. And yet one- and two-horse races are now the theme, the standard, and the expectation of what is considered the finest spectacle in motorsport.

So as we enter a new year, here's to Fernando Alonso getting a decent car; to Robert Kubica making an astounding comeback; even, perhaps, to Renault, Williams, and Force India competing alongside Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull. And with that in mind, perhaps the championship of what, in a few short hours, will be ten years ago should weigh on our minds.

In the wake of 2007, one could understand a bit of disgruntlement on the part of most drivers. Alonso had just missed out on a title charge; his soon-to-be-former teammate Hamilton had watched the title slip through his fingers among somewhat suspicious circumstances (for more of which, see /u/119169's excellent assessment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7mx2d0/back_to_the_future_2007_season_recap/)). Even Felipe Massa, whose teammate romped to the title and just barely managed to snatch it away from the dominant McLarens, had grounds for annoyance, having to watch from fourth (a situation not unlike Kimi's today).

But, as the first race (in Australia, on the sixteenth of March) approached, all thoughts of 2007 were forgotten, and another season was just beginning.

---

**Rounds 1-6**

*Round 1*

Australia, the season opener, would prove who had made best use of the off-season. Defending constructors' champions Ferrari put on a disappointing showing, Felipe Massa failing to finish and Kimi Raikkonen coming only eighth as Lewis Hamilton won from Nick Heidfeld and Nico Rosberg (the latter recording his first podium in Formula 1). However, they would soon prove to be a threat.

*Round 2*

The next race, in Malaysia, Ferrari rallied, Raikkonen coming first and his teammate Massa setting pole (though the Brazilian failed to finish after spinning off about halfway through). Heikki Kovalainen and Hamilton came third and fifth, while Robert Kubica scored the second podium of his Formula 1 career in second. Sauber were second in the constructors' championship, astonishingly, though they were soon to be supplanted.  The greatest drama that weekend was off the circuit, as the FIA's president Max Mosley faced...certain accusations, the nature of which I'd prefer not to discuss.

*Round 3*

The season looked to be shaping up as Bahrain came and went, Massa and Raikkonen forming a Ferrari 1-2 as they pleased with Kubica following in their footsteps. The McLarens garnered just four points, all won by Kovalainen, and Sauber improved to first in the constructors' as Raikkonen improved to first in the drivers'. Hamilton's charge after a collision with Alonso, meanwhile, came to nothing, as he finished thirteenth.

*Round 4*

The drivers opened the European season in Spain, Raikkonen and Massa finishing first and second ahead of Lewis Hamilton. Raikkonen now held a firm nine-point championship lead over Hamilton, Kubica, and Massa, the team's excellent finish propelling them to first in the WCC as well.

*Round 5*

In Turkey it was a similar story, as Raikkonen placed third behind race winner Massa and second-placed Hamilton. The off-track drama continued, as the poorly-budgeted team of Super Aguri was forced to pull out of contention altogether. It looked to be something of a boring championship, much as this year's battle looked to continue to season's end at the start.

*Round 6*

But at Monaco, as the first act of our story closes, a wrench was thrown into the race. As Hamilton won (Kubica and Massa coming second and third), Raikkonen suffered a disastrous race scoring no points at all after colliding with Adrian Sutil (remember him?), propelling Hamilton to first in the championship. Jackie Stewart foreshadowed Lewis's future success as he lauded the Briton's victory, saying:

>At his age, Lewis can win this race many times...this is the first, I hope, of many victories for him in Monaco so that he can join the greats of Formula One.

**Rounds 7-12**

*Round 7*

It's always seemed rather strange - at least to me - that Canada sits so squarely within the middle of the otherwise European season. No matter; Kubica scored his first and only Formula 1 win (*thus far*, ahem ahem) as polesitter Hamilton collided with Raikkonen and Rosberg. Kubica's win made him - at least for now - the championship leader.

*Round 8*

The last French grand prix until 2018 was won by Massa as Raikkonen's engine failed and their future competitor Esteban Ocon looked on. Raikkonen and Jarno Trulli rounded out the podium. The topsy-turvy championship continued, Massa now leading overall.

*Round 9*

Even before winning his first race in Great Britain, Lewis Hamilton was ecstatic:

> There's something about racing in your home country that affects you. The constant support of the crowd gives you a boost throughout the whole weekend. It's not something you experience anywhere else, but it does make you that bit more determined to succeed.

He would go on to take a dominant yet bizarre win (the first in his native land of many to come) ahead of Heidfeld and Rubens Barrichello, with nearly every driver spinning at least once and Massa spinning four times. Lewis now led the championship in a three-way tie on forty-eight points.

*Round 10*

Hamilton was again imperious in Germany, setting pole, dropping back due to a late safety car period, then making up the deficit with an overtaking move used on both Massa and Nelson Piquet Jr. which would become one of his signature moves: making as if going for an outside line, then taking advantage of it to use the next corner's inside line. Though it had been done before, Hamilton would go on to execute it many more times over his career (most recently in Mexico on Fernando Alonso this year). There was no change in either championship.

*Round 11*

Luca di Montezemolo, the irritated president of Ferrari, disliked the way the sport was going, realising that if ever it entered another period of total domination, they would most likely not be the ones controlling it as they had been in the first half of the decade. Hence, he started the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA), which would utterly collapse in future years. In the race itself, Hamilton's lead dropped to five points over Raikkonen, as Kovalainen took his only F1 victory.

*Round 12*

Massa's victory in the European Grand Prix finally marked him out as a true title challenger, cutting Lewis's lead to just six points ahead of the final act of the season. It remained to be seen who would be champion, but the fight was rapidly narrowing to its two principal combatants.

5 | Heikki Kovalainen | 43

**Rounds 13-17**

*Round 13*

In Belgium, in arguably the most controversial race of the year (although, of course, there is yet Singapore to speak of), on track Hamilton pulled off a brilliant race to win ahead of Massa and Heidfeld. However, Hamilton was penalised for an iffy pass on Raikkonen - receiving a twenty-five-second penalty, a matter of great debate, as it placed him third. McLaren appealed, but the appeal was rejected on the grounds that a twenty-five-second penalty was un-appealable.

*Round 14*

In Italy, though, the sport got back to nice, clean racing, and exciting racing, too. Sebastian Vettel, future four-time world champion, won for the first time, also giving Toro Rosso its first and, thus far, only victory. Lewis Hamilton led by a point as the championship picture slowly changed from logical to mathematical.

*Round 15*

Singapore. Possibly the darkest day in recent Formula One history, up there with Kubica's Canadian crash and Jules Bianchi's death, Singapore 2008 is the only known instance of a racer intentionally crashing in hopes of assisting his teammate: Piquet, who hit the wall at Turn 17, aiding Alonso in a first-place finish, his first of the season. The incident was later investigated, of which more can be found in /u/TheStateOfIt's brilliant post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7dbmma/random_driver_highlight_15_nelson_piquet_jr/).

*Round 16*

Alonso's second victory followed very quickly after his first of the year, coming at Japan. Potential champions were now limited to Hamilton, Massa, and Kubica. There were just two races to go, in China and Brazil.

*Round 17*

Lewis Hamilton won in China to extend his WDC lead over Massa, the only other possible champion, to seven points (ninety-four against eighty-seven). To win the championship, Felipe would not only need to win the last race in his home country of Brazil; he would also need Hamilton to do worse than fifth.

**Round 18**

Brazil was Felipe Massa's last victory. Fernando Alonso was second, and Kimi Raikkonen was third.

The real action, though, was in Hamilton's desperate attempts to secure fifth place. He started fourth - good enough - but quickly moved into third. Then, after a round of early pitstops, he found himself sixth, then fifth, then fourth once again. He ran third for two laps, but his second journey to the pits dropped him all the way to sixth. He charged back to fourth. And then: disaster struck.

A light downfall began, halting the battle for fourth between Hamilton and Vettel as they dove to the pits for the final time. As of lap 72 of 73, not only had Vettel passed Hamilton, so had Glock due to the two's pitstops. Hamilton was running sixth.

1 | Felipe Massa| 10
2 | Fernando Alonso | 8
3 | Kimi Raikkonen | 6
4 | Timo Glock | 5

6 | Lewis Hamilton | 3

Felipe Massa had already won the race, and in the closing seconds, there was little anyone could do. Lewis Hamilton had, once again, come breathtakingly close to the championship, but the way the cards had fallen, along with his own driver errors, he had missed out.

The agony of the last few seconds was practically unbearable. By the final corners, Lewis had caught up to fifth-placed Glock (Sebastian had passed him a few corners earlier in the lap), but there wasn't time to pass him if he kept it together, even in these conditions. Hamilton's only advantage was fresher tyres - *wet* tyres, unlike Glock's. Timo Glock hadn't stopped, you see.

And then, on the last corner of the last lap of the last race - the very last chance of all - Timo Glock went wide, Lewis Hamilton cut inside - avoiding collision by inches - and came out in fifth, crossing the line to win the world championship.

**Post-Race**

Ferrari, at least, had the constructors' championship to console themselves with - the last time the drivers' champion hasn't driven for the constructors'. But the agony of defeat - of, especially, last-second, last-gasp defeat - could not be felt more acutely among the *tifosi.* Famously, one Ferrari employee put a fist into the wall after seeing Hamilton's pass on Glock, while Lewis's girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and boss Ron Dennis rushed out of the McLaren garage in disbelief.

Felipe Massa's handling of the situation was remarkably sportsmanlike, noticeable amid his fans' fury. His speech on the podium has entered Formula One legend:

>We need to congratulate Lewis because he did a great championship and he scored more points than us, so he deserves to be champion. I know how to lose and I know how to win and as I said before it is another day of my life from which I am going to learn a lot.

---

**Conclusion**

Perhaps 2008 was unfair. Perhaps Spa and Singapore tainted the championship, introducing an element of randomness. But history is history, and Lewis Hamilton would go on to be the most successful British Formula 1 driver in history, while Felipe Massa would steadily decline after an unfortunate crash the following year. The former celebrated a forty-six point victory over Sebastian Vettel this year; the latter bowed out of Formula 1 following an unsuccessful final season with Williams.

I do not wish to say that Felipe Massa does not deserve to be champion; certainly, on merit at least, he should secure a place in Formula 1 history, though it will perhaps be less that of a Schumacher than a Barrichello.

But as 2017 leaves and 2018 approaches, perhaps it is time to leave our baggage of the past behind. All praise to 2008 for a brilliant season - but all eyes are now on 2018 to provide an even better one.

Cheers!
